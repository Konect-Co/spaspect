## Features

- Customizable dashboard for users
  - Displays real-time and aggregate analytics
  - Comes with 3D map and overhead map for better visual perspective
- Predictive modeling: predicts scale of COVID-19 spread in certain areas
- Tracking
- Tracing feature: draws line following individuals on 3D map

### Realtime Analytics

Real-time analytics include the number of unmasked individuals, undistanced individuals, and total number of individuals.

### Aggregate Analytics

Aggregate analytics include people vs time graph, distance distribution curve, crosslocation, etc (long term).

## Impact

During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing and face covering are two cardinal measures to prevent the spread of this virus. Problematically, the public is breaching the COVID-19 regulations and local governments and cities have no effective way of making such observations.

### Use Cases

- Local governments can use to strategize enforcement
- Businesses can use to see how they&#39;re doing in terms of reopening
- Can be used in universities during reopening process
